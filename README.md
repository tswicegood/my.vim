Travis Swicegood's .vim/
========================
This is just a collection of the files, plugins, syntaxes, etc., etc.,
that are accumulating in my `~/.vim/` directory.


Usage and License
-----------------
You can use it, if you really really want to.  This for me to have access to
from multiple machines, but if you want to be just like me, have at it.

All plugins, etc., are distributed under their original license.  There's very
little original work here.


Requirements
